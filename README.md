# Comma Separator
This script will automatically add a comma after every line in the .txt file.

## How to use
In order to use this, you will first need to download and un-zip this repository. After doing that, you will need to paste the list of emails into the emails.txt file. MAKE SURE THAT EACH EMAIL IS ON A SEPARATE LINE OTHERWISE THIS WON'T WORK. After you have all the emails on the emails.txt file, make sure you save, and then run main.py. After running main.py, make sure you check the formattedEmails.txt for the formatted emails.
